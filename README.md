# SwiftUIPHPicker

`SwiftUI` wrapper of [`PhotoKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit)'s  [`PHPickerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phpickerviewcontroller).  

The majority of the base of the code came from Hacking With Swift's post on this very topic: <https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/importing-an-image-into-swiftui-using-phpickerviewcontroller>. I added more practical extensions, as well as ease-of-use with [`PhotosPicker`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/photospicker), which is only available in iOS 16+.
