# SwiftUIPHPicker

`SwiftUI` wrapper of [`PhotoKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit)'s [`PHPickerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phpickerviewcontroller).  

The majority of the base of the code came from Hacking With Swift's post on this very topic: <https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/importing-an-image-into-swiftui-using-phpickerviewcontroller>.

I added support for more than 1 selection, as well as practical extensions, and hope to extend for ease-of-use with [`PhotosPicker`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/photospicker), which is only available in iOS 16+.

## To-Do's
- [x] Add support for multiple selections.
- [ ] Add support for selecting other Live Photos and videos (currently only supports standard photos).
